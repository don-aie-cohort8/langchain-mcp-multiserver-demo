# 🧭 Project Overview

> **Purpose:** A clear, friendly entry point for anyone exploring this repository.  
> Think of this as your “README for humans” — what someone new needs to understand *why* this project matters and *how* it fits.

---

## 🚀 1. What This Project Does
Explain the core idea in 2–3 sentences.  
- What problem does it solve?  
- Who benefits from it?  
- Why is it interesting right now?

> 💡 **Example**  
> This repo demonstrates how to connect multiple MCP servers using LangChain’s MCP adapter, showing a practical pattern for hybrid human–AI collaboration.

---

## 🧱 2. Architecture Overview
Provide a short description of how the system works at a high level.  
You can embed a simple diagram or pseudo-diagram if helpful.

**Example:**
```
User → LangGraph Agent → MCP Server(s) → External Tools → Response
```

If you already generated `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`, summarize key insights here.
