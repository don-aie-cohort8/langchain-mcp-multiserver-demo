# 🚀 START HERE — Storytelling with Cursor

### Why this exists
Every great project deserves a great story.  
The **Storytelling & Reflection Suite** helps you turn your technical repo into a shareable, teachable artifact — with one consistent workflow.

It’s not just about writing docs — it’s about learning to **Build • Ship • Share** with clarity and confidence.

---

### What it does
This suite gives you one command flow to generate:

1️⃣ **Project Context Doc** – what the repo is about  
2️⃣ **Repo Overview (README)** – a friendly landing page  
3️⃣ **Architecture Summary** – how it works  
4️⃣ **Slides** – for a 5-minute presentation  
5️⃣ **Video Script** – what you’d say in that video  
6️⃣ **LinkedIn Post** – how you’d share it publicly  
7️⃣ **Learning Reflection** – what you learned doing it  

All outputs are written to:  
`storytelling/output/`  
and use templates from:  
`storytelling/templates/`

---

### How to use it
In **Cursor**, just type natural instructions — no file paths required.  
Cursor automatically handles templates, output locations, and file names.

#### 🔥 Dope example (creative tone)
Make it pop and draw people in:

```
1. Generate project context doc
2. Create the repo overview and architecture summary.
3. Finish with slides and a short video script — and make it sizzle!

```

#### 🧭 Refined example (professional tone)
For a more conventional walkthrough:

```

Run the Storytelling & Reflection Suite.

1. Generate project context doc
2. Generate repo overview
3. Generate architecture summary
4. Generate presentation slides
5. Generate video script
6. Generate LinkedIn post
7. Generate learning reflection

Tone: coaching, peer-friendly. Target video < 5 minutes.
Outputs go to storytelling/output/ and use templates from storytelling/templates/ when present.

```

---

### Mindset
- Keep your tone **peer-friendly and coach-like**.  
- Treat each doc as a **checkpoint** in your learning journey.  
- Add `TODO:` notes instead of skipping what you don’t know — that’s real growth.  
- Focus on **progress and reflection**, not perfection.

---

### TL;DR
You’re not just documenting your work —  
you’re **teaching the story** of how you built it.

Start with:
```
Generate project context doc
```

Then keep shipping. 🚀
