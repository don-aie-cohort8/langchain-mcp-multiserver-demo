[SCREEN] Title slide
Hi friends — quick walkthrough of our LangChain MCP Multi-Server Integration project. In under five minutes, I'll cover the problem, the architecture, a short demo, and what we learned building this educational tool for AI engineers.

[SCREEN] Problem & Audience
Here's the challenge: when you're building AI agents, you need them to connect to multiple external services — weather APIs, math libraries, custom tools. But each service has its own API, its own way of working. It's like trying to speak multiple languages at once. The Model Context Protocol, or MCP, solves this by providing a standardized way for AI agents to discover and use tools from different servers. Our audience is AI engineers who need to orchestrate multiple tool servers efficiently.

[SCREEN] Solution Architecture
Our solution uses a multi-server MCP architecture. We have a central LangChain agent that connects to multiple specialized servers through a MultiServerMCPClient. Each server provides specific tools — weather data, math operations, custom functions. The key insight is that we support both stdio and streamable-http transport methods, so you can deploy servers locally or as web services. The agent automatically discovers available tools and can reason about which ones to use for any given task.

[DEMO] Key Moment(s)
Let me show you this in action. First, I'll start the weather server on port 8000, then the LangChain tools server on port 8001. Now I'll open our Jupyter notebook and run a simple query: "What's (15+27)*3?" Watch as the agent automatically discovers the available tools, calls add(15,27) to get 42, then calls multiply(42,3) to get 126. The full trace shows exactly how the agent reasoned through this multi-step problem. Next, let's try "What's the weather in NYC?" — the agent correctly identifies this needs the weather tool and calls get_weather("NYC"). The beauty is in the seamless orchestration across different servers.

[SCREEN] Learnings & Guardrails
What we learned: MCP standardization makes tool integration predictable and scalable. The dual transport approach gives you deployment flexibility — stdio for local development, streamable-http for web deployment. Our display utilities make complex agent reasoning transparent, which is crucial for debugging and learning. We built in connection pooling, graceful error handling, and comprehensive response formatting. The stateless tool design prevents cross-server state conflicts, and the centralized client management simplifies orchestration.

[SCREEN] What's Next + CTA
We're planning to add authentication patterns, LangGraph state management examples, and monitoring integration with LangSmith. The educational materials are designed to grow with the community. If this helps you build better agentic systems, drop a comment with your own MCP server examples or questions about multi-server patterns. The full code and documentation are linked below — let's keep pushing the boundaries of what AI agents can do together.
