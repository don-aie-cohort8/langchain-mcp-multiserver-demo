**Building multi-server AI agents with MCP — what we learned**

• One big insight: standardized protocols make tool integration predictable across different services.  
• Dual transport (stdio + streamable-http) gave us deployment flexibility without complexity.  
• Educational debugging utilities turned complex orchestration into learnable patterns.

The Model Context Protocol isn't just about connecting tools — it's about creating composable AI systems that can grow with your needs.

If you've built multi-server agent architectures, what pattern or tool made the biggest difference for you?
