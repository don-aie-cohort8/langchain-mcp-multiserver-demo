**Migrating agents from simple loops to LangGraph — what surprised us**

• One big shift: explicit graphs gave us reliability without losing speed.  
• Guardrails weren’t optional — they made demos production‑ready.  
• Human + AI pairing let us ship faster *and* safer.

If you’ve done a similar migration, what guardrail or workflow tip made the biggest difference for you?
