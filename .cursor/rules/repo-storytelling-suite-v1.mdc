# Repository Storytelling and Reflection Suite (v1)

## Rule Set Overview
This rule suite helps you turn any AI engineering or LangGraph project into a cohesive narrative — complete with a README, architecture doc, slides, video script, and LinkedIn post.

### Rule 1: Repository Context Capture
```
Review this repository and identify:
1. The purpose of the project and its intended audience.
2. The technical stack across LLM App Stack layers.
3. The architectural patterns used.
4. Any milestones or key results worth highlighting.
Summarize findings in /PROJECT_CONTEXT.md.
```
